            <p>I am Sowjanya Kambhampati, a Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in web development, user interface design, and project management. My experience, though less than a year, includes developing and launching scalable web applications such as BuurtHub, a platform designed to foster community engagement and support local economies, and StyleSavvy, a versatile beauty service booking application. I am passionate about creating user-friendly solutions and am skilled in technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, and JavaScript.

I am always eager to take on new challenges, continuously learn, and contribute to meaningful projects. My recent experience at Ironhack, where I won first place in the HackShow competition, has further sharpened my technical skills and ability to work effectively in fast-paced environments. I'm excited to bring my problem-solving skills and dedication to delivering high-quality solutions to a Full Stack Developer role at your company.</p>
